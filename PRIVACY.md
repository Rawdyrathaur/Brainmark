# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 6, 2025**

## Overview

Tab Story is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our Chrome extension.

## Our Privacy Commitment

**Tab Story is built with privacy at its core:**
- Your data stays on your device
- We don't track your browsing activity
- We don't collect personal information
- We don't use analytics or telemetry
- We don't sell or share your data with third parties

## What Data We Process

### Local Data Storage

Tab Story stores the following data **locally on your device** using Chrome's storage API:

1. **Tab Information**
   - Tab titles and URLs
   - Tab groups and their organization
   - Custom notes you add to tabs
   - Timestamps of when tabs were created or modified

2. **Intent Data**
   - Intent names and descriptions you create
   - Relationships between tabs and intents
   - Intent-related metadata

3. **User Preferences**
   - Extension settings and configurations
   - Storage management preferences
   - UI customization options

4. **Backups**
   - Automatic backups of your tab groups
   - Browsing timeline data

**Important:** All this data is stored exclusively in Chrome's local storage on your device. It is never transmitted to our servers or any third-party services.

## How We Process Your Data

### Chrome Built-in AI (Primary Method)

When you use AI features (like tab summaries or intent detection):

- Processing happens **entirely on your device** using Chrome's built-in AI capabilities
- Your tab content and browsing data **never leave your computer**
- No internet connection is required for AI processing
- No data is sent to external servers

### Gemini API (Optional Fallback)

If Chrome's built-in AI is unavailable, Tab Story may use the Gemini API as a fallback:

- This feature is **optional** and only used when Chrome's built-in AI isn't available
- If used, only the specific content you request to summarize is sent to Google's Gemini API
- Data sent to Gemini is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- You can disable this fallback in the extension settings

## What We Don't Do

- **No tracking:** We don't track your browsing habits, behavior, or patterns
- **No analytics:** We don't collect usage statistics or telemetry
- **No cookies:** We don't use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- **No data collection:** We don't collect, store, or transmit your personal information
- **No third-party sharing:** Your data is never sold, shared, or transmitted to third parties
- **No advertising:** We don't use your data for advertising purposes
- **No profiling:** We don't create user profiles or behavioral patterns

## Data Security

- All data is stored using Chrome's secure storage API
- Data remains on your local device at all times
- You have complete control over your data
- You can delete all extension data at any time through Chrome's extension settings

## Your Rights and Control
